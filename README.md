May the Grindâ„¢ never end.

1. We don't use the word **work-life balance**. (that's cringe)

2. There's **no weekends**. (every second matters)

3. Burn-out is a **psyop** and a myth. (you're just weak)

4. Sleep is for the **weak**. (you can sleep when you're dead)

5. Personal relationships are **a distraction**. (you don't need friends)

6. $100k is **not enough**. (you're poor)

7. Don't think about life, just **Grind**â„¢ . (you're a machine)

8. Feelings are evil, **suppress** them. (you're a robot)

9. Attending conferences is good, but **don't network**. (you're a lone wolf)

10. You only need a **laptop**. (you're a digital nomad)

11. **Grind**â„¢ is the truth. (never stop)

  <summary>Important note</summary>

The Grindlinesâ„¢ are meant as satire, poking fun at the hustle culture that often glorifies unhealthy work habits. They're not intended to be taken seriously.

We believe in the value of dedication and hard work, but we also recognize the importance of balance, mental health, and community. This project encourages mindful grinding â€” committing to your goals with awareness of the risks, such as burnout, isolation, and tunnel vision.

Take care of yourself, connect with others, and remember that you're more than your Grindâ„¢. ðŸ’ª
