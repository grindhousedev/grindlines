# The Great Grinding Guidelines 🫡

[![Grind Compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grind-Compliant-blue)](https://github.com/The-Grindhouse/guidelines)

1. We don't use the word **work-life balance**. (that's cringe)

2. There's **no weekends**. (every second matters)

3. Burn-out is a **psyop** and a myth. (you're just weak)

4. Sleep is for the **weak**. (you can sleep when you're dead)

5. Personal relationships are **a distraction**. (you don't need friends)

6. $100k is **not enough**. (you're poor)

7. Don't think about life, just **grind**. (you're a machine)

8. Feelings are evil, **suppress** them. (you're a robot)

9. Attending conferences is good, but **don't network**. (you're a lone wolf)

10. You only need a **laptop**. (you're a digital nomad)
